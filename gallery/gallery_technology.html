            <h2>Metallurgy</h2>
            <p>Early evidence of metal in the Indian subcontinent includes a copper bead found in Mehrgarh, Baluchistan, dating back to around 6000 BCE. Iron metallurgy began with the earliest iron objects in India dating back to 1400 BCE, and large-scale iron smelting started around the 13th century BCE. India was one of the first to extract zinc using distillation, as seen in the ancient mining site of Zawar in Rajasthan, dating to the 6th century BCE. Metal alloys such as bronze and brass were used for tools, weapons, sculptures, and coinage.</p>
            <p>The Harappans perfected the wax technique for metal casting as early as the third millennium BCE, and the exchange of metallurgic sciences with the Near East and Greco-Roman world further enhanced India's tradition of metallurgy. The Mughal era marked another period of advancements in metalworking.</p>

        <div class="text-content">
            <h2>Stepwells</h2>
            <p>Stepwells were built between the 7th and 19th centuries in Gujarat and Rajasthan, India. Over 3,000 stepwells served as vital sources of water, especially in the semi-arid regions. These intricate structures, often 20 to 25 meters deep, were used not only for water collection but also as social and spiritual spaces, particularly for women. Many stepwells were funded by wealthy individuals, including royalty, and were often built in honor of deities or deceased loved ones.</p>
            <p>These wells were designed to tap into underground aquifers, utilizing seepage from monsoon runoff. The art and craft of stepwell construction have been passed down through generations, though modern water infrastructure threatens to overshadow this traditional knowledge.</p>

            <h2>Ancient Textile</h2>
            <p>Bandhani is a traditional Indian textile art form involving tie-dyeing fabrics, with origins tracing back to the 6th century BC in Gujarat. The name comes from the Sanskrit word "bandhana," meaning "to bind." These textiles hold cultural significance, being used in clothing such as sarees and lehengas and also symbolizing Indian identity.</p>
            <p>Kalamkari, another ancient textile art, involves hand-painting or block-printing with natural dyes. Originating in Andhra Pradesh, Kalamkari gained prominence during the Vijayanagara Empire. There are two main styles: block-printed in Machilipatnam and hand-painted in Srikalahasti.</p>
